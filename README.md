# Project
The caf√© landing page is my take on creating a simple landing page consisting of four sections (including a footer) using only HTML5 and CSS. The purpose of this project was to test out my skills in building a simple webpage for the first time and using CSS flexbox to arrange all of the elements present on the page.

# Challenges & Solutions
Some of the key challenges I faced while building the landing page:

- **Creating a parallax background scrolling effect**
    - I say Google is your best friend when it comes to finding solutions to problems. I always thought parallax scrolling effects were fantastic and wanted to have one for my page. As such, I looked up various resources on how to apply it to websites through YouTube videos and StackOverflow.
- **Adjusting the position of boxes/elements**
    - Another challenge was using flexbox, margin, padding, and all that to get everything to align just the way I wanted. The best way to figure this out was to just play around with the values to see what happens (especially if you're starting out) and eventually you get a feel for how to properly manipulate all the elements on the page.
- **Typography and picking fonts**
    - A minor challenge, but I think it's important to be able to pick and choose the right type of font-family and color to make the website look aesthetically pleasing. Google Fonts was my best friend and helped me test out different fonts before I landed on picking three for the landing page.

# Comments & Suggestions
I'd love to receive any feedback you might have on the landing page. I'm open to suggestions for improving the written code. As of right now, the code is very crude and I'm looking to clean it up and enhance the features of the page as I learn more about web development.
